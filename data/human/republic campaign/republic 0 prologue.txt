# An explanation of the structure of the prologue:
#
# The prologue is made of two major mission chains (Jane Melgrew and Amelia Shah)
# and three minor mission chains (Jeff Haas, Hines, and Intelligence).
#
# At least one of the major chains and two of the minor chains are to be completed
# before the player is able to progress to the start of the Republic campaign. The
# first Beelzebub missions also count as a minor mission.
#
# These missions are spread across Republic space as to represent the grand scale
# of the Republic and the number of ways the player is able to help this massive
# government. Melgrew and Shah effectively serve as the "North" and the "South"
# introductions of the campaign, though you can encounter both of them before
# you progress to the start.

To your surprise, though, among the standard weather advisories for small ships and featured deals on trade goods or local services there is a pilot-only bulletin from the Navy. Or more specifically, a bulletin from the local traffic control on behalf of the Navy. It seems that they've given their various contract management officers more scope to hire independent captains for odd jobs, and while that's not been announced it seems to be a poorly kept secret, at least among merchants.`
